# Fun Generation Scripts
This is where I document the fun generation scripts I make in my spare time.

### circles.py
Places one "spotlight" for each RGB channel and saves an image of the final result.

### snowflake.py
Uses recursion and the 'turtle' package to generate a little snowflake.

### voronoi.py
Uses a brute-forced voronoi algorithm to make a cool gradient.

### vancian-culture.py
Rolls on a slightly modified version of random tables provided [here](http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2021/11/human-non-universals-or-make-your-own.html) to sow seeds for a Vancian-style culture.

# TODO
 - don't overwrite old images with new ones
 - parameterize scripts so they can be called with values from the command line
