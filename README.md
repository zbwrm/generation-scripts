# Fun Generation Scripts
This is where I document the fun generation scripts I make in my spare time.

### circles.py
Places one "spotlight" for each RGB channel and saves an image of the final result.

### snowflake.py
Uses recursion and the 'turtle' package to generate a little snowflake.

### voronoi.py
Uses a brute-forced voronoi algorithm to make a cool gradient.
